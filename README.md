# GardenControl
Control of different functions in our garden including automated watering using Arduino and Android App
The control is pretty simple basically comprising a relais shield conected to an Arduino MEGA with the relais switching different devices in the garden. The Arduino is controlled via bluetooth through a mobile device by an Android App programmed in MIT App Inventor. The repository contains the Android App as apk file (for installation on the Android device), aia file (to import into App Inventor for editing the App) and the ino file to be uploaded to the Arduino MEGA.
